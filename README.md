# 1080Motion - Training App Work Test

Starting code for a timeboxed work test for a full stack developer position.

## Task

Build a full-stack training management application using ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. The application should allow users to manage athletes, exercises, and training groups.

Below is a list of things to implement. Try to implement as much as possible, but don't get stuck for too long on any specific task.

If you skip some part of the task, be prepared to discuss during the interview how it could be solved

### Time Limit
This is a timeboxed exercise. The task is expected to take approximately **4-5 hours** to
complete, but you can spend as much or as little time as you want.


### Backend Requirements (ASP.NET Core)
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for:
    - **Athletes**: Manage athlete profiles
    - **Exercises**: Manage exercise definitions
    - **Groups**: Manage training groups
- Use the provided in-memory database
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Add basic validation for input data

### Frontend Requirements (React)
- Create a user interface to interact with all backend endpoints
- Implement the following views:
    - List all athletes/exercises/groups
    - Create new athletes/exercises/groups
    - Edit existing records
    - Delete records
- Display appropriate feedback for user actions (success/error messages)
- Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly

### Stretch Goals 
- Add the ability to assign athletes to groups
- Implement basic search or filtering functionality
- Add loading states and error handling in the UI
- Add unit and/or integration tests for the backend

### Deliverables

Source code (either in a public repo or as a zip file)

- Code structure, design choices. How will you scale?
- Did you use more time than expected? Or less? If so, why?
- What would you do differently next time?
